In this section, the shiny app provides an interactive section for dinamyc prediction of the mortality rate of a specific month using previous information. As statistician at 1850, would you be able to provide an accurate prediction of the future mortality rate?      

We offer both linear and exponential smoothing models to predict the mortality rate.      

_Predicted value corresponds to the red point while the observed points correspond to the black points._
