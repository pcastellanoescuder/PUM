We compare the probabilities of death at different dates pre- and post- sanitary measures.      

The user can perform the comparison based on the risk difference and risk ratio.          

This app returns the probability in each of the selected dates, the effect measure to compare the two probabilities (risk difference and risk ratio), the statistical test, and whether or not we reject the null hypothesis based on the test.
