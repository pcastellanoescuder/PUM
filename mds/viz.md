Here, we present some plots for illustrating Florence Nightingaleâ€™s data on deaths from various causes in the Crimean War.     

We reproduce Nightingale's Area Diagrams, illustrate the cumulative causes of death over time, explore the correlation betweeh causes of death and show the mortality per year through barplots.     

The user can choose whether to plot the mortality rate per 1000 or the number of deaths using the button "**Number of deaths**".
